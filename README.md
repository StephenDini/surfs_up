The purpose of this analysis is to compare the temperture during a hot month and a cold month in order to see if it might be profitable to sell ice cream during the old months.

# Results

1. June's sample size is larger by about 11 percent
2. The minumum temperature is ten degrees lower in December
3. The maximum temperature is only 3 degress lower in December

# Summary
In my opionion the temperature will not prohibit the ability to sell ice cream. While December does have colder weather, the average is roughly the same. 

Two new queries were ran using the station 'USC00519281'. Singling out a station has also showed similar results. The sample sizes are closer to each other with June only at around 8 percent larger.
